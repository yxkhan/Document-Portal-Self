# Project description

## Document Analysis, Chat & Comparison Portal with Advanced RAGx
```
 In this project, i have built a robust, interactive portal for document analysis and
 intelligent chat using advanced RAG pipelines. Using ingest and index documents,
 implement semantic search, and create conversational interfaces for both single and multiple
 documents. I have explored optimization with local LLMs, caching strategies, and reranking
 techniques. Additionally full-stack deployment using FastAPI and Streamlit,
 alongside CI/CD and AWS deployment with GitHub Actions and Fargate.
